# Memory management
## C++
* Memory management can be done manually via `new` / `delete`, automatically by scope, or by smart pointers. Supports deterministic destruction of objects. Garbage collection ABI standardized in C++11, though compilers are not required to implement garbage collection.
## Java
* Automatic garbage collection. Supports a non-deterministic finalize() method use of which is not recommended.
