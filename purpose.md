## Language Purpose/genesis
* C++ was designed for systems and applications programming, extending the procedural programming language C, which was designed for efficient execution. To C, C++ added support for object oriented programming, exception handling, lifetime-based resource management, generic programming, template metaprogramming, and the C++ Standard Library which includes generic containers and algoithms, and many other general purpose facilities.
  * Goals of C++:
  * Extends C with object-oriented programming and generic programming. C code can most properly be used.
  * Compatible with C source code.
  * Write once, compile anywhere (WOCA).
  * Runs as native executable machine code for the target instruction set(s).
  * Provides object types and type names. Allows reflection via run-time type information (RTTI).
  * Has multiple binary compatibility standards (commonly Microsoft (for MSVC compiler) and Itanium/GNU (for almost all other compilers)).
  * Optional automated bounds checking (e.g., the at() method in vector and string containers).
* Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to minimize implementation dependencies. It relies on a Java virtual machine to be secure and highly portable. It is bundled with an extensive library designed to provide a full abstraction of the underlying platform. Java is statically typed object-oriented language that uses a syntax similar to C++.
  * Goals of Java:
  * Provides the Java Native Interface and recently Java Native Access as a way to directly call C/C++ code.
  * Write once, run anywhere/everywhere (WORA/WORE).
  * All operations are required to be bound-checked by all compliant distributions of Java.
  * Runs on a virtual machine.
  * Has one binary compatibility standard, cross-platform for OS and compiler.
  * Automatic garbage collection. Supports a non-deterministic finalize() method use of which is not recommended.
