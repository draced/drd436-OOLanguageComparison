#Language Purpose/genesis
* C++ was designed for systems and applications programming, extending the procedural programming language C, which was designed for efficient execution. To C, C++ added support for object oriented programming, exception handling, lifetime-based resource management, generic programming, template metaprogramming, and the C++ Standard Library which includes generic containers and algoithms, and many other general purpose facilities.
* Java is a general-purpose, concurrent, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to minimize implementation dependencies. It relies on a Java virtual machine to be secure and highly portable. It is bundled with an extensive library designed to provide a full abstraction of the underlying platform. Java is statically typed object-oriented language that uses a syntax similar to C++.
