# Comparing references and values
## C++
* Can overload `==operator` to define comparison.
## Java
* You use `operator!=` or `operator==` when you want to check for identity of two objects (if they are actually the same object).
* You use `equals()` when you want to check for equality. (if two object are equal, as the `equals()` method defined them).
